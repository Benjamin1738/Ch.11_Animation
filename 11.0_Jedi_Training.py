4.) How many pixels/sec does the ball move in the y-direction?
3
5.) Which method is run 60 times/second?
when updating the balls position
6.) What does this code do?   self.dx *= -1
send object other direction

8.) What is the width of the window?
640
9.) What is this code checking?  self.pos_y > SH - self.rad:
position of radius on y axis
